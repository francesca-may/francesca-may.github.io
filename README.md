# Hello there! :wave:
My name is Francesca Ellis. I'm proud to be the Technical Support and Learning Manager at the worldâ€™s leading augmented reality platform and creative studio - Zappar :zap: (& ZapWorks :gear:!)

I'm not currently looking for other opportunities, but watch this space as I'd love to share what I've learned from working with such a fantastic team of people.
